## What is this?
This is a simple Linked List implementation in C, utilizing void pointers to store references to any sized piece of data within it. I created this project as a challenge for myself to learn some basic principles of low-level programming languages such as pointers and memory allocation. All in all, I'm pretty happy with how it came out, and I certainly got a lot out of this project.
